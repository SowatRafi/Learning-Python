**Encapsulation**

    Process of restricting access to methods and variables to prevent direct data modification.

    Public methods and variables are accessible from anywhere in program.

    Private methods and variables are accessible from their own class.

    Double underscore prefix before object name makes it private.

    Set method is used to set value for variable while get method is used to retrived the value of the variable.
