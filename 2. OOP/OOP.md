**Object-Oriented-Programming**

    Type od programming that breaks things into objects that interacts with each other.
    
    Objects are created from classes.

    Object Oriented Programming encourage code reuse through D.R.Y. concept (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Object**

    An object can be an entity or anything in your program like a noun.

    Examples of real world objects includes things around us like Houses, Cars, Banks Accounts, Pets etc.

**Class**

    A class is a blueprint(template) for creating objects.

    Classed can have properties(attributes) which are like variables that store data.

    Classes can also have behaviours(methods). These are like functions.

    You can create many unique objects from a single class.

`__init__()`

    It is a built-in function in Python. Also known as the initialazer. Used to initialize objects with initial values. All classes should have them. It is called automatically when a new object is created from a class.

`self`

    This parameter is a refernece to the current instance of the class. It is the first parameter of any method(functions) in a class. It is used to access variables and methods belonging to the class. Also used to add attributes to a method.


**Class Variables**

    Defined outside any method.
    Accessed outside class with className
    Not prefixed
    Modifications affects all class instances
    Classes are idented
**Instance(Object) Variabels**

    Defined inside class methods.
    Accessed outside class with objectName.
    Prefixed with self keyword.
    Modifications to objects is local.
    Instances are not indented.
