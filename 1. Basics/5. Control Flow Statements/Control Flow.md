**Control Flow**

* This is the order in which the program's code executes.
* They help your program make decisions.
* The control flow of a Python program is regulated by:
    * Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
    * loops (`for` and `while`)
    * Function calls
    
`if`

    Used to check conditions before it executes certain code.
    They help your program make decisions.
    They only run code in _if-block_ when condition is True.
    They use comparison and logical operators to check conditions.

`else`

    Code that executes if conditions checked evaluates to False.

`while`

    Used to execute a set of statements(code) continuously as long as True.

`for`

    Used to iterate over a sequence.
    Sequence is usually: (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string)
    Does not require an indexing variable to initiate loop.
    They can use break and continue statements.

`break`

    Used to break out of a loopstatement. (stop the loop)
    It will break the loop even if condition is still True.

`continue`

    Used to stop the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

`range()`

    range() function is a built-in function of Python.
    The range() function generates the integer numbers between the given start integer to the stop integer, which is generally used to iterate over with for Loop.
    The range() function returns a sequence of numbers starting from zero by default.
    Default increment is by 1 and ends at a specified number
