**Python Number Data Types**

* Integers (int)
  * Integer is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
    
    _Examples:_ `0` `100` `-324` `22486`
      

* Floating Point (float)
  * Floating point number is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
    
    _Example:_ `0.34` `2.4` `-43.5423`
    

* Strings (str)
  * Strings are sequence of character data.
  * Strings are enclosed in either single or double quotes.
  * All characters between the opening quote and closing quotes are part of the string.
  * Strings can contain any characters you want including spaces.
  * A string can also be empty `""`
  
* Boolean (bool)
  * Boolean type may have one of two values, `True` or `False`
  
**Casting**
  * _Casting_ is the process of converting the value of a variable from one data type to another.
  * This is done using various built-in Python Functions.
  * `Int()` converts value to an integer (whole number).
  * `Float()` converts value to floating point number (decimal).
  * `str()` converts value to string (text).
