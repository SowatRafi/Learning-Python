### Linear Search Algorithm

* Start with the leftmost element of the list and compare by one.
* If the key element is found return the index of the element and break the loop.
* If the key element is not found in the list return `-1`

### Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is an algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

* Sort the list.
* Compare `k` with the middle most element of the list.
* If `k` matches with the middle element then we return mid index.
